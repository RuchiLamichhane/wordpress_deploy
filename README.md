# WordPress Web Application Deployment Using Docker

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my expertise in deploying and managing WordPress web applications using Docker. The deployment process ensures scalability and efficiency through containerization, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes orchestration.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Containerization
- **Used Docker to containerize WordPress and its dependencies**, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments.
- Created Dockerfiles for custom configurations and extended functionality.

### 2. Docker Compose
- **Implemented Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications**, including WordPress, MySQL, and Nginx.
- Developed `docker-compose.yml` files to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

### 3. Scalability
- **Configured and optimized containers for scalability**, handling increased traffic and resource management.
- Ensured high availability and load balancing using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

### 4. Orchestration Using Kubernetes
- **Implemented Kubernetes for container orchestration**, managing WordPress deployments in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Configured Kubernetes pods, services, and deployments for efficient resource management and scalability.

## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Configuration file to containerize WordPress.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to manage multi-container setup.
- `k8s/`: Directory containing Kubernetes deployment files.
- `docs/`: Documentation for setting up and using the Docker and Kubernetes environments.

## Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use the official WordPress image
FROM wordpress:latest

# Set environment variables for WordPress
ENV WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db
ENV WORDPRESS_DB_USER=user
ENV WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=password
ENV WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress

# Copy custom configuration files if needed
COPY custom-config.php /usr/src/wordpress/wp-config.php

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80
